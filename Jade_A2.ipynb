    "I am interested in how different groups discuss their relationships with food online, particularly how specific foods are moralized and constructed to be \"healthy.\" The fitness community has many subgroups that demonize certain food groups, primarily carbs which can be seen in diet trends like \"Keto,\" \"Paleo,\" and \"Counting Macros.\" Even something so simple as describing highly processed foods as \"junk\" conveys a moral argument about the worth of certain foods, and by extension, the worth of the people who regularly consume them. This moralistic rhetoric, often accompanied by images of idealized bodies or bodies to shame (or both in before-and-afters), can inspire restrictive dieting and fears surrounding certain foods and bodies. But opposition groups have also arisen to try to combat this ideology, like the body positive movement. This community tries to celebrate bodies of diverse sizes, shapes, and abilities while removing moralistic associations with food to allow for an \"intuitive\" eating relationship that tries to reduce the stress of other eating practices. There is perhaps even a third community of professionals (dietians, public health officials, doctors) who acknowledge the need of moderate diets to address the consequences of obesity (particularly in the US), but how this problem is larger than just eating and includes food deserts, economic inequality, easy access to nutrient deficient foods, and corporate incentives. These communities have competing definitions of what constitutes \"healthy.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In this research project, I aim to use Twitter data to identify how people describe and conceptualize \"healthy\" food and eating and how this differs across subgroups. I am also interested in whether these subgroups are interconnected - is there cross-talk across these groups or are they relatively distinct with separate cultures and understandings of health? Does the professional group attempt to infilitrate fitness influencer or body positive conversations as a part of public health campaigns to give people access to other types of food/diet information? Do certain fitness/diet groups co-op the language of \"obesity\" and \"obesity crisis\" as a moralistic term aimed at scaring people into particular ways of eating? Does the body positive movement discredit the metrics and tools of other communities (BMI, calorie counting) to re-establish their own understanding of healthy? I am interested in computationally analyzing these conversations to better understand how healthy food and eating are constructed online. "

    "I am planning on using the Twitter API to scrape tweets related to these groups and topics of healthy eating and food. I think Twitter is perhaps the best social media site to use for this project because it includes so many diverse groups on the same platform. It also primarily centers around text conversations which allows us to better see how people are talking about these subjects. The replies/mentions can be easily analyzed too so we can see whether there is cross-talk or if the groups are distinct. I have also conducted a prior project using the Twitter API and scraping data, so I feel more comfortable conducting this analysis in the short time frame. I think Tiktok may skew a little younger and more informal so would likely have fitness and body positive content, but perhaps not professionals. It also centers around videos more so than text and I'm interested in how people talk about these concepts - but it would be interesting to expand my skill set to try to get video transcriptions or how the images in videos relate to their short descriptions/tags. Reddit would be another option, but I am less familar with the pages that I would need to scrape to effectively cover these conversations. This might make a good backup plan though as I am a little concerned that searching Twitter for \"healthy\" right now may return more COVID content than food (I'll try to address this with conditions). Reddit might allow for more granular searches, but may not have as much back-and-forth which I am interested in studying. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding how to write a query that effectively picks up all these communities without grabbing too much irrelevant information will be a big challenge for the final version of this project. I'm trying to capture my idea of the three communities, but this might be baiting searches. Ideally, I want this project to be a combination of identifying linguistic and cultural communities and describing how they differentially use language and understand health and eating. If I am too granular with my searches, I might just be returning findings that I expect since I've filtered them to be that way, rather than capturing the potential complexities of larger cultural patterns. If I leave this query too broad, I may end up with irrelevant or disparate information which makes it challenging to find meaningful cohesive groups. If you have any recommendations on how to balance these problems, I'd love to discuss it in more depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "I just perform a topic analysis here where I try to assess how people are talking about healthy eating and whether these are distinct or more mixed. I am curious about this \"moralistic\" dimension of discourse. However, I find this is a little more difficult to capture. Perhaps the phrase \"clean eating\" is easier to identify as moralistic since it's associating certain types of food and eating practices with being \"clean\" and others as \"dirty.\" But how do we capture the moral dimension of \"fat\" since it's used in so many contexts? Fat could be mentioned as one of the macronutrients needed in a healthy diet, an insult or fear from so many online, or a reclaiming of the word to find neutraility in it as just a descriptive adjective as seen in the bodypositive community. This sort of different meanings of words for different groups is challenging to capture both without and certainly with computational methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, I don't explicitly perform any network analysis. I am primarily interested in identifying the primary topics in Tweets and whether these are relatively pure (separate groups with distinct linguistic patterns/ideologies) or whether they are more mixed (groups sharing language/ideologies). I think that in the final version of this analysis, it could be interesting to plot which users are interacting with who and how their language differs. It would be intersting to not only identify what topics people are discussing and whether these are relatively distinct, but also to see how these people and these topics interact/intersect in networks/threads. If this is perhaps too much, it could be easier to look at what tweets caused the most discussion or were the most popular based on their retweet, like, or other engagement counts. "

    "The biggest lesson that I've learned from these few rounds of data cleaning/processing and running the topic models, is that there is still a lot of work to be done to narrow down my desired content. For the first topic (sexual), I need to re-think and clarify the search query. I didn't realize that bodypositive was being used to advertise explicit content on Twitter. Perhaps if I combine this phrase with eating or healthy, I will narrow down my desired results. Topic 1 is actually the topic that I'm interested in and it seems like this one has more to do with concepts of healthy eating and foods. The final topic 3 demonstrates that there is still spam getting through this cleaning. Spam can be interesting when it includes companies or multilevel marketing groups reaching out to others on Twitter to market their products - we could look at what lanaguage they use to convince people to buy their diets. However, this particular topic seems to be one user tweeting the same encouraging messages at all his friends. This is likely to continue at scale. I think the best way to handle this going forward is to groupby users (author_id) and calculate the similarity metrics between their tweets, if it's above a certain threshold, then we can drop them. This might be computationally expensive but will hopefully allow us to actually see trends amongst the topic 2 group. For now, I'm going to handle this problem by dropping the observations that are in topics 0 or 2 and re-run this one more time. "

    "Through this exploratory topic analysis of a small Twitter dataset, we have identified a few groups that differentially use vocabulary related to attitudes towards healthy eating and foods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our first round of topic analysis, we discovered a different use of the term “body positive.” This phrase had been created and used to identify a rebellious community that contradicted larger norms that encourage people to diet to achieve a “perfect” body. They insist that there are many bodies that can be healthy and that these eating practices and their related ideologies can actually have negative consequences on people’s self-conception and mental health. However, this term was now primarily being used on Twitter to market sexual content like OnlyFans. This shows how terms can be co-opted by other groups and it makes me wonder about why Twitter users are using this term specifically to market their explicit content. I think that the use of this phrase is trying to denote a shared interest in accepting all body types and, in doing so, attract a clientele that supports this activist cause and perhaps is seeking content from creators who have different body shapes. This demonstrates how even a phrase can undergo the circle of culture as it was created for a particular group and purpose but can be used by any groups and can shift its meaning depending on context. Without any overarching regulation, which is the case on most social media sites, these terms might not have the same strict definitions or meanings, particularly for people in disparate communities that are not controlling how the word is used. We additionally saw that there are Twitter users that spam others. There are accounts that tweet the same message repeatedly (whether at celebrities like the K-pop scandal surrounding a star’s diet) or to market a particular product (weight loss diets) or just tweeting at each of their friends to check up on them (like user 1469123406050168835). This type of behavior is typical of social media websites but is difficult to imagine happening in person. It is perhaps not useful for this project unless I wanted to dive more deeply into the ads or spam tweets and what language they use to encourage people to diet, but it does demonstrate how online and in-person conversations and language differ. This will be important for interpreting any of our findings, as we are limited by the medium which gives us a different angle to understand multifaceted cultural patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our second topic analysis, we demonstrated that there are smaller communities within the larger conversations about healthy eating. There is a very clear and defined vegan community (topic  0) that focuses on sharing vegan recipes, promoting their ways of eating (govegan), and their moral reasons for their diet (cruelty free). There were also smaller topics that focused on keto diets and how effective they were for losing weight (topic 1). I originally thought that there was also a more public health-oriented topic that discussed the intersection of obesity, diabetes, pregnancy, illiteracy, and the disparities of these by location and age (topic 3). However, looking at it, we can see instead it’s a Twitter user using public health statistics to ridicule Southern states.  There were still many topics that were not as interpretable (4, 5, 6) or too specific (an Arby’s ad campaign). There was still the overarching category that discussed our primary interests of eating, calories, food, diet, losing weight, and health together (topic 1). This perhaps illustrates that there are a few subcommunities that discuss these subjects, but they do not use meaningfully different vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, from this analysis I can see the potential for different topics and smaller subgroups amongst Twitter users who discuss health and eating. There seems to be a large focus on calorie tracking and dieting, but there are also efforts to share resources and healthy recipes by different definitions (as seen with the vegan and keto groups). I think there are some serious limitations and room to improve in this analysis, which I will discuss next. \n"

    "As seen with the repeated efforts to further clean this dataset, there are some serious areas for improvement that will hopefully clarify cultural patterns around eating practices, concepts of healthy, and diet culture.\n",
    "\n",
    " The first step is to clarify the query. Right now, the query is returning tweets from many disparate communities and some undesired information (explicit content & spam). I think a more concise and focused query may better capture tweets related to my primary interest around healthy eating and then I will use secondary methods to try to identify whether there are distinct communities like fitness influencers, public health professionals, body positive activists, or those looking primarily looking for/promoting weight loss tips. I want to make this query broader to focus on larger ideologies surrounding ideologies surrounding healthy eating and eliminate some of the more specific words (calorie, keto, body positive). I do worry that a broader query may again return some irrelevant information – but as I discussed before, I think I have a new strategy to remove spam and hopefully the explicit content will be removed by eliminating the term “body positive.” \n",
    "\n",
    "After I test this new query, I want to scale this project up to be able to capture larger cultural patterns on Twitter surrounding healthy eating. This generalizability will be limited by my Twitter developer account which can only scrape information from the prior 7 days. Therefore, no longitudinal arguments can be made. However, it offers us greater insight into these communities’ function, interact, and talk within a large enough time frame given the quick and short-lived nature of Twitter discussions. I will collect all available pages of Twitter data for my given query. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am also interested in further exploring the networks of these communities. Right now, we have only performed an exploratory analysis of what general language is used to discuss healthy eating. However, we don’t know how these topics are being used in groups. Are there groups that primarily discuss obesity in an academic tone? The body positive activists? I think combining the topic analysis with a network analysis would help clarify what, if any, subgroups there are among those who discuss healthy eating on Twitter and if they talk about topics in meaningfully different ways. I think this network analysis might be best constructed by drawing ties between users who retweet/reply to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I think there are some additional model selection steps that could be conducted that might make these topics more interpretable. There’s some additional hyperparameter tuning, text cleaning, and testing more models that could be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think these additional steps would allow me to better capture conversations about healthy eating, identify relevant subgroups and their use of language, and generalize these to the level approaching Twitter culture. I am interested in discussing this project in more depth with you all to see if you would recommend additional steps or have advice on how to conduct the steps I’ve proposed. \n"
